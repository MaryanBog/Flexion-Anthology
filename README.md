# Flexion Anthology

Flexion Anthology is a collection of **derived and interpretative works**
built on top of the Flexion Framework.

This repository does **not** define the Flexion Framework itself.
It contains theories, specifications, and normative constraints that
**reason about**, **interpret**, or **limit** what follows from the
Framework.

## Scope

Included here are works that:

- do not introduce new structural variables,
- do not redefine the Flexion evolution law,
- do not alter core invariants,
- but provide interpretation, risk reasoning, or admissible boundaries.

## Structure

- `Flexion-Risk_Engine/`  
  Structural interpretation of risk and proximity to collapse.

- `Flexionization-Control-System/`  
  Normative specification of admissible, non-invasive control surfaces.

## Status

All documents in this repository belong to the **Flexion Anthology** layer
and are **not part of the Flexion Framework core**.
